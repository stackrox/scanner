# Steps to benchmark node scanning 

## Pre steps:

quay.io/repository/rhacs-eng/sandbox:benchmark-node-analyze-1.0 is an Ubi8 based image with vim, RPM and RPM-build installed. Those packages are necessary for benchmark node analyze function


execute
```
docker run -it --rm quay.io/rhacs-eng/sandbox:benchmark-node-analyze-1.1
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In the running ubi8 container, `cd tmp-specs` folder and make sure `generate-rpm-specs.sh` is there (check dockerfile line 6)

2. execute the bash file: `bash generate-rpm-specs.sh [number of the RPM specs]`. You will be able to see the RPM spec files in the folder
```
bash generate-rpm-specs.sh 1000
```
3. execute
```
rpmbuild -bb *.spec
```
You will see output like: `Wrote: /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/package_name9-0-0.x86_64.rpm` This gives you the path where RPM files were generated to.
 
4. install all packages using the rpm files just created: yum localinstall <path to rpm files>/.*rpm  
```
yum localinstall /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/.*rpm
```
5. check the running ubi containers by executing: `docker container ls` and get the container id of the container where you are currently installing the rpm packages

6. execute `docker export [container id]>[tar name].tar` (e.g `docker export c8c57bb7e926>demoV1.tar`) and unzip the tar ball to get the file system

7. Go to **scanner/benchmarks/analyzeNode** folder and execute command:
```
RHCOS_TEST_PATH="path/to/file/system" go test -bench=. -benchmem
```
